That ability is locked within kombu (kelp) and katsuo bushi (smoky bonito fish flakes), the two ingredients used to make this basic sea stock: Both are both rich in water-soluble glutamates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it takes only a few minutes to make dashi, timing and temperature control is important. To extract the full potential of the kelp\'s flavor-enhancing properties, you need to start the stock from cold water, slowly bringing it barely to a boil – the point at which small bubbles begin to break on the surface, and around the rim of your pot. Then, to prevent the broth from becoming murky, and to hold possible bitterness at bay, you need to remove your pot from the stove before adding the fish flakes. That way, the smoky, full-bodied flavor of the flakes can seep into the broth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Makes about 1 quart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 generous quart cold water; use filtered or bottled water for best results</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6-8 square inches (15 to 20 sq.centimeters) kombu (kelp; Hidaka kombu is the preferred type)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1/2 cup loosely packed (2, 5-gram packets) katsuo bushi (dried bonito flakes)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Place the kelp in a pot with the water. If time permits, let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes before placing the pot over medium-high heat. Remove the pot from the burner as soon as small bubbles begin to break on the surface and at the rim of the pot. Remove the kelp. Add the fish flakes, scattering them across the surface of the broth. After several minutes the fish flakes will begin to sink. The larger the flakes, the longer it will take. Those at the top of a freshly opened bag might take 5 or 6 minutes, while the powdery bits that settle at the bottom of the package could sink almost immediately. To keep the stock from tasting \"fishy\" it is best to strain the broth through a cloth or paper-lined colander within 3 or 4 minutes of adding the flakes.', '', 'http://www.tasteofculture.com/display-text.php?pd_key=92', 1, '2012-11-24 00:01:31', '2012-11-24 00:01:31'),

Around 30 minutes is ideal. If marinating for more than an hour (say, overnight), use 1 tablespoon soy sauce, then add the other 2 tablespoons just before you\'re ready to cook them; this prevents the salt in the soy sauce from drawing out too much moisture from the chicken.\r\n4.

(10, 'Philadelphia Cheesesteaks', 'Ingredients:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPublished March 1, 2012.   From Cook\'s Illustrated.\r\n\r\nWhy This Recipe Works:\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBringing cheesesteaks home required coming up with a simple and economical way to mimic the thinly shaved slivers of rib eye usually obtained with a meat slicer. We found that when partially frozen, skirt steak’s thin profile and open-grained texture made for easy slicing, and its flavor was nearest to rib eye but without the sticker shock. To best approximate the wide griddle typically used in Philadelphia, we cooked the meat in two batches, letting any excess moisture drain off before giving it a final sear. Finally, to bind it all together, we let slices of American cheese melt into the meat, along with a bit of grated Parmesan to boost its flavor.\r\n\r\nServes 4\r\n\r\nIf skirt steak is unavailable, substitute sirloin steak tips (also called flap meat). Top these sandwiches with chopped pickled hot peppers, sautéed onions or bell peppers, sweet relish, or hot sauce.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- 2 pounds skirt steak , trimmed and sliced with grain into 3-inch-wide strips\r\n- 4 (8-inch) Italian sub rolls , split lengthwise\r\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n- 1/8 teaspoon pepper\r\n- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\r\n- 8 slices white American cheese (8 ounces)\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1. Place steak pieces on large plate or baking sheet and freeze until very firm, about 1 hour.\r\n2. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread split rolls on baking sheet and toast until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.\r\n3. Using sharp knife, shave steak pieces as thinly as possible against grain. Mound meat on cutting board and chop coarsely with knife 10 to 20 times.\r\n4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until smoking. Add half of meat in even layer and cook without stirring until well browned on 1 side, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir and continue to cook until meat is no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer meat to colander set in large bowl. Wipe out skillet with paper towel. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sliced meat.\r\n5. Return now-empty skillet to medium heat. Drain excess moisture from meat. Return meat to skillet (discard any liquid in bowl) and add salt and pepper. Heat, stirring constantly, until meat is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, sprinkle with Parmesan, and shingle slices of American cheese over meat. Allow cheeses to melt, about 2 minutes. Using heatproof spatula or wooden spoon, fold melted cheese into meat thoroughly. Divide mixture evenly among toasted rolls.

Trim the cutlets if necessary to get rid of any excess fat. (Note, some tonkatsu afficionados leave the fat on, but I like to cut it off.) Make small cuts all the way around the cutlet. This prevents it from shrinking and curling up when cooked.\r\n2. Lightly season the cutlets with salt and pepper. Dust the cutlets in flour, then dip in the beaten egg, coating the surface thoroughtly. Finally roll in the breadcrumbs.\r\n3. Heat the oil to medium heat, about 170°C / 340°F.\r\n4. Deep fry the cutlets in the oil, turning a couple of times, until golden brown. You can tell if it\'s done by poking it. If it feels firm, it\'s done. If it yields to pressure, then it\'s not done yet.\r\n5. Drain thoroughly. Cut with a sharp knife into slices while still hot.\r\n6. Arrange on a plate with finely shredded cabbage, and condiments to taste: lemon wedge, mustard (not the French kind, but the English kind - plain mustard powder that\'s been reconstituted with water), tonkatsu sauce (available at Japanese grocery stores) or steak sauce.\r\n7. A complete tonkatsu dinner is usually rounded out with a miso soup, some pickles and plain rice.', '', 'http://justhungry.com/2004/01/tonkatsu.html', 1, '2013-09-30 15:55:53', '2015-05-25 04:18:25'),

(51, 'Quicker Cinnamon Buns', 'MAKES 8 BUNS - about 2 hours start to eat\r\n\r\nSince the filling, dough, and glaze all require melted butter, its easier to melt all 10 tablespoons in a liquid measuring cup and divvy it up as needed. Stir the melted butter before each use to redistribute the milk solids. We developed this recipe using a dark cake pan, which produces deeply caramelized buns. If your cake pan is light-colored, adjust the oven rack to the lowest position, heat the oven to 375 degrees, and increase the baking time to 29 to 32 minutes.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\nFILLING\r\n\r\n- 3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces) light brown sugar\r\n- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar\r\n- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\r\n- 1/8 teaspoon salt\r\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\r\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n\r\nDOUGH\r\n\r\n- 1 1/4 cups whole milk, room temperature\r\n- 4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast\r\n- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\r\n- 2 3/4 cups (13 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour\r\n- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\r\n- 3/4 teaspoons salt\r\n- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\r\n\r\nGLAZE\r\n\r\n- 3 ounces cream cheese, softened\r\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\r\n- 2 tablespoons whole milk\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n- 1/8 teaspoon salt\r\n- 1 cup (4 ounces) confectioners\' sugar, sifted\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. FOR THE FILLING: Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in bowl. Stir in melted butter and vanilla until mixture resembles wet sand; set aside.\r\n\r\n2. FOR THE DOUGH: Grease dark 9-inch round cake pan, line with parchment paper, and grease parchment. Pour  cup milk in small bowl and microwave until 110 degrees, 15 to 20 seconds.

If fresh Thai chiles are unavailable, substitute 2 serranos or 1 medium jalapeo. In Thailand, crushed red pepper and sugar are passed at the table, along with extra fish sauce and white vinegar, so the dish can be adjusted to suit individual taste.

During testing, we noticed that adding sugar to the recipe significantly toned down the heat of the chiles. It turns out that this phenomenon is the result of complex interactions in the brain that regulate our perception of flavor, pitting pain against pleasure. Compounds in chiles (mainly capsaicin) stimulate nerves (called trigeminals) surrounding the taste buds to signal discomfort to the brain, in a process known as chemesthesis. Sugar, on the other hand, stimulates the taste buds to signal pleasure. These signals are so enjoyable, scientists believe they overshadow the pain caused by chiles.', '', 'America\'s Test Kitchen Season 11: Asian Favorites at Home', 1, '2015-12-28 23:57:27', '2015-12-28 23:59:45'),

(68, 'Lemon Posset', 'Lemon posset is a silky, rich British dessert with bright citrus flavor. We found that using just the right proportions of sugar and lemon juice was the key to custard with a smooth, luxurious consistency and a bright enough flavor to balance the richness of the cream. Lemon zest was essential to making the lemon flavor even more prominent. For a posset with an optimally dense, firm set, we reduced the cream-sugar mixture to 2 cups to evaporate some of the water before adding the lemon juice, which in turn caused the mixture to solidify. Letting the warm mixture rest for 20 minutes before straining and portioning allowed the flavors to meld even more and ensured a silky-smooth consistency. Pairing the dessert with fresh berries for textural contrast helps keep it from feeling overly rich.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 2 cups heavy cream\r\n-  cup (4  ounces) granulated sugar\r\n- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest plus 6 tablespoons juice (2 lemons)\r\n- 1  cups blueberries or raspberries\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\nServes 6\r\n\r\nThis dessert requires portioning into individual servings.

If you can only find wet scallops, soak them in a solution of 1 quart cold water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons table salt for 30 minutes before proceeding with step 1. In step 2, season the scallops with pepper only. If you are unsure whether your scallops are wet or dry, conduct this quick test: Place 1 scallop on a paper towel-lined, microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power for 15 seconds. If the scallop is dry, it will exude very little water. If it is wet, there will be a sizable ring of moisture on the paper towel. (The microwaved scallop can be cooked as is.) Prepare the sauce (if serving) while the scallops dry (between steps 1 and 2) and keep it warm while cooking them.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Sprinkle ribs with ground fennel and generously season with salt and pepper, pressing spices to adhere. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of ribs, meat side down, and cook, without moving them, until meat is well browned, 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining ribs; set aside.\r\n\r\n2. Reduce heat to medium and add onion, fennel, carrots, 2 tablespoons sage, rosemary, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to now-empty pot. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits, until vegetables are well browned and beginning to stick to pot bottom, 12 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Add 1 cup wine and cook until evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and broth and bring to simmer. Submerge garlic and ribs, meat side down, in liquid; add any accumulated juices from plate. Cover and transfer to oven. Cook until ribs are fork-tender, about 2 hours.\r\n\r\n4. Remove pot from oven and transfer ribs and garlic to rimmed baking sheet. Using large spoon, skim any fat from surface of sauce. Once cool enough to handle, shred meat from bones; discard bones and gristle. Return meat to pot. Squeeze garlic from its skin into pot.

FOR THE PORK: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes.\r\n2. Add garlic, cumin, oregano, allspice, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste begins to darken, about 45 seconds. Stir in water, orange juice concentrate, 2 tablespoons vinegar, Worcestershire, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper, scraping up any browned bits.\r\n3. Add pork and bring to boil.

Off heat, stir in remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve on tortillas with pickled red onions, habanero sauce, and lime wedges.\r\n\r\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo make cochinita pibil, the inspiration for our recipe, a whole suckling pig is swaddled in bitter orange juice and banana leaves before being nestled under a pile of hot coals to stew. To make this process feasible for a home cook, we substituted pork butt for the whole pig. We nixed the banana leaves and annatto, a spice typically used in this dish but hard to find. Instead we added bay leaves for herbal flavor and Worcestershire for meaty tanginess. Tomato paste gave the meat its vibrant color. A quick habanero sauce and pickled red onions balanced out the rich meat.\r\n\r\nSERVES 6\r\n\r\nPork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket. For a spicier sauce, add an extra habanero or two; if you are spice-averse, substitute less-spicy jalapeos for the habaneros.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST KITCHEN TIP: SAFELY HANDLING HABANEROS\r\n---\r\n\r\nTake our word for it: Dont handle habaneros with your bare hands. The capsaicin levels are so high that they can irritate your skin (or worse, your eyes). To protect yourself, wear disposable latex gloves. In a pinch, zipper-lock bags can serve as makeshift gloves.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATING COCHINITA PIBIL\r\n---\r\n\r\nAuthentic cochinita pibil is full of hard-to-source ingredients, including ultratender whole suckling pig, fragrant banana leaves for wrapping the pork during cooking, and annatto (pebble-like seeds that contribute color and a mild herbal flavor). We skipped the banana leaves since the flavor contribution is negligible, swapping in substitutes for the rest.\r\n\r\n- PORK BUTT: Well-marbled, collagen-rich pork is nearly as succulent and tender as suckling pig.\r\n- BAY LEAVES: These provide an herbal aroma thats similar to that of annatto.\r\n- TOMATO PASTE: Concentrated tomato paste adds saturated color, just as annatto does.\r\n\r\nON THE ROAD: TRACKING TACOS IN EAST LOS ANGELES\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn 2010, when Armando De La Torre Sr. turned 50 and decided to open a restaurant, he reached back to the comfort food of his youth, the guisados (stews and braises) that his mother used to make. Growing up we didnt come home to carne asada. Like many Mexican families we ate guisadostinga, calabacitas, picadowith beans and tortillas. One-pot meals. I remember sneaking into the kitchen, and my mom would be yelling that it wasnt ready, but Id run in, grab a tortilla, and make a taco out of whatever she was cooking. Thats how I enjoyed her food.\r\n\r\nScores of brightly colored signs hang above the storefronts and restaurants that pack Cesar Chavez Avenue in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles. The vibe on the avenue is mildly gritty yet a little tender, and the smiles I encounter are genuinely warm. A few steps inside Guisados, I stop at the counter to take in the large chalkboard menu that climbs to the ceiling; pitchers of aguas frescas sit next to the register. Im mesmerized by a woman hand-patting tortillas from a bowl of fresh masa and slapping them onto the hot griddle. She moves quickly and flips the hot tortillas with her bare hands. I order several tacos and finish up just as Armando and his son, Armando Jr., arrive to greet me.\r\n\r\nWe head outside around the back of the building, step down through a low door, and make our way up a flight of stairs to the Guisados prep kitchen. Theres a blur of shuffling bodies and bubbling pots, and the aroma of chiles and cumin hangs thick in the air. Armando Sr. dips a spoon into a guisado, clearing the chile-laced oil slick on top, and offers up a taste of the meat and pepper combination from its lower depths. Again, Im mesmerized.\r\n', NULL, 'From Cook\'s Country | June/July 2016', 1, '2017-05-03 20:36:50', '2017-05-06 22:36:55'),

(84, 'Thin-Crust Pizza', 'From America\'s Test Kitchen Season 12: New YorkStyle Pizza at Home\r\n\r\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\r\n\r\nKneading our pizza doughs ingredients in the food processor was quicker and just as efficient as using a stand mixer. To keep our ThinCrust Pizza recipe from puffing as it cooked and to infuse it with flavor, we let it proof in the refrigerator for up to three days. Finally, placing our pizza stone as close to the upper heating element as possible crisped our ThinCrust Pizza and browned it.\r\n\r\nMakes two 13inch pizzas\r\n\r\nOur preferred brand of wholemilk mozzarella is Sorrento Galbani. You can shape the second dough ball while the first pizza bakes, but don\'t top the pizza until right before you bake it. If you don\'t have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet. It is important to use ice water in the dough to prevent overheating the dough while in the food processor. Semolina flour is ideal for dusting the peel; use it in place of bread flour if you have it. The sauce will yield more than needed in the recipe; extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month.\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n---\r\n\r\nDough\r\n\r\n- 3 cups (16 1/2 ounces) bread flour, plus more for work surface (see note)\r\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast \r\n- 1 1/3 cups ice water (about 10 1/2 ounces) (see note)\r\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for work surface\r\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt\r\n\r\nSauce\r\n\r\n- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and liquid discarded\r\n- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\r\n- 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar\r\n- 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\r\n- 1 teaspoon table salt\r\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\r\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\r\n\r\nCheese\r\n\r\n- 1 ounce finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup)\r\n- 8 ounces whole milk mozzarella, shredded (about 2 cups) (see note)\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. FOR THE DOUGH: In food processor fitted with metal blade, process flour, sugar, and yeast until combined, about 2 seconds. With machine running, slowly add water through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough stand 10 minutes.\r\n2. Add oil and salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove dough from bowl and knead briefly on lightly oiled countertop until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into tight ball and place in large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.\r\n3. FOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl or container and refrigerate until ready to use.\r\n4. TO BAKE THE PIZZA: One hour before baking pizza, adjust oven rack to second highest position (rack should be about 4 to 5 inches below broiler), set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half. Shape each half into smooth, tight ball. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray; let stand for 1 hour.\r\n5. Coat 1 ball of dough generously with flour and place on wellfloured countertop. Using fingertips, gently flatten into 8inch disk, leaving 1 inch of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12inch round, working along edges and giving disk quarter turns as you stretch. Transfer dough to wellfloured peel and stretch into 13inch round. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 1/4inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through. Remove pizza and place on wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat step 5 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.\r\n\r\nTOPPING TIPS: We like our ThinCrust Pizza simply dressed with tomato sauce and handfuls of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, but additional toppings are always an optionprovided they\'re prepared correctly and added judiciously. (An overloaded pie will bake up soggy.) Here are a few guidelines for how to handle different types of toppings:\r\n\r\nHEARTY VEGETABLES Aim for a maximum of 6 ounces per pie, spread out in a single layer. Vegetables such as onions, peppers, and mushrooms should be thinly sliced and lightly sauted (or microwaved for a minute or two along with a little olive oil) before using.\r\n\r\nDELICATE VEGETABLES AND HERBS Leafy greens and herbs like spinach and basil are best placed beneath the cheese to protect them or added raw to the fully cooked pizza.\r\n\r\nMEATS Proteins (no more than 4 ounces per pie) should be precooked and drained to remove excess fat. We like to poach meats like sausage (broken up into 1/2inch chunks), pepperoni, or ground beef for 4 to 5 minutes in a wide skillet along with 1/4 cup of water, which helps to render the fat while keeping the meat moist.\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE\r\n---\r\n\r\nNO MORE SNAP BACK\r\n\r\nDough that shrinks back when you roll it out is one of the pesky factors that keep a crust from ever baking up truly thin.\r\n\r\n1. ADD JUST ENOUGH WATER Create a relatively wet but not too wetdough, which stretches without tearing and stays tender once baked.\r\n2. PROOF IN FRIDGE Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. This leads to less rise, a more flexible dough that holds its shape, and a thinner (and more flavorful) final crust.\r\n3. DIVIDE Halve dough and shape into balls. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let rest 1 hour to allow dough to return to room temperature.\r\n4. FLATTEN On wellfloured surface and using fingertips, gently flatten dough into 8inch disk, leaving outer edge slightly thicker than center to create a fatter \"handle.\"\r\n5. STRETCH With hands, stretch dough into 12inch round, working along edges and giving dough quarter turns. Transfer to wellfloured peel and stretch to 13inch round.\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE\r\n---\r\n\r\nKEEPING INFLATION DOWN\r\n\r\nThe biggest factor contributing to a crust that turns out thick versus thin is the size of the air bubbles in the dough before it goes into the oven. The more the bubbles expand with carbon dioxide as the dough ferments (or proofs), the thicker the final crust. Could a longer rise in the refrigerator fix the problem?\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nWe made two batches of dough, leaving one to rise at room temperature for four hours and placing the other in the refrigerator for 24 hours, then baked them both according to our recipe.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe dough left to rise at room temperature produced a crust that puffed up like focaccia, while the dough that rose in the fridge baked up with smaller bubbles and boasted far more flavor.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION\r\n\r\nFermentation is a twophase process: First, the carbohydrates in the dough are converted by the yeast to sugars, alcohol, and acids. Next, these convert to carbon dioxide, expanding the bubbles created in the dough when it was first mixed. At room temperature, the process moves rapidly to the production of carbon dioxide. But in the fridge, the process is slowed way down. With enough time, the complextasting sugars, alcohol, and acids form, but very little carbon dioxide gets converted, so the bubbles in the dough stay small and the crust bakes up both thin and more flavorful.\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE\r\n---\r\n\r\nSHRINK YOUR HEADROOM\r\n\r\nBaking the pizza on the top rackrather than the usual approach of placing it near the bottom of a home oven means heat will hit the top of the pie, browning the toppings before the crust overcooks.', NULL, 'America\'s Test Kitchen', 1, '2017-08-26 15:43:40', '2017-08-26 15:50:59');

Work quickly when pouring the caramel mixture over the egg mixture in step 4 to ensure proper thickening. Serve the pudding with lightly sweetened whipped cream.\r\n\r\n1. Bring butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, water, corn syrup, lemon juice, and salt to boil in large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar and melt butter. Once mixture is at full rolling boil, cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes (caramel will register about 240 degrees). Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer (caramel should maintain steady stream of lazy bubblesif not, adjust heat accordingly), stirring frequently, until mixture is color of dark peanut butter, 12 to 16 minutes longer (caramel will register about 300 degrees and should have slight burnt smell).\r\n\r\n2. Remove pan from heat; carefully pour 1/4 cup cream into caramel mixture and swirl to incorporate (mixture will bubble and steam); let bubbling subside. Whisk vigorously and scrape corners of pan until mixture is completely smooth, at least 30 seconds. Return pan to medium heat and gradually whisk in remaining 3/4 cup cream until smooth. Whisk in 2 cups milk until mixture is smooth, making sure to scrape corners and edges of pan to remove any remaining bits of caramel.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, microwave remaining  cup milk until simmering, 30 to 45 seconds. Whisk egg yolks and cornstarch together in large bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk in hot milk until smooth; set aside (do not refrigerate).\r\n\r\n4. Return saucepan to medium-high heat and bring mixture to full rolling boil, whisking frequently. Once mixture is boiling rapidly and beginning to climb toward top of pan, immediately pour into bowl with yolk mixture in 1 motion (do not add gradually). Whisk thoroughly for 10 to 15 seconds (mixture will thicken after a few seconds). Whisk in vanilla and rum. Spray piece of parchment paper with vegetable oil spray and press on surface of pudding.

Whisk pudding until smooth before serving.\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE\r\n---\r\n\r\nSmoother Route to Pudding?\r\n\r\nPudding recipes almost always have you temper the yolks and cornstarch (i.e., add some hot dairy to the mixture to gradually raise its temperature), add everything to the remaining dairy in the pot, and stir constantly as the mixture slowly comes to a boil and thickens. Inevitably, bits of egg still overcook and need to be strained. We wondered if there was a better way.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT:\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe made one batch of pudding the conventional way and a second batch in which the yolks never saw the heat of the stove: We added a little warm milk to the yolks and cornstarch, brought the remaining dairy (in our recipe, the butterscotch mixture) to a boil, and then dumped this hot liquid over the egg mixture and whisked briefly as the pudding thickened almost instantly.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe conventional pudding needed straining, while the no-cook custard was utterly smooth and perfectly thickened.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION:\r\n---\r\n\r\nBoiling pudding is overkill. When cornstarch is combined with liquid, it thickens between 144 and 180 degrees, while yolks diluted by liquid coagulate between 180 and 185 degreessignificantly lower temperatures than the boiling point of 212 degrees. Whisking the hot butterscotch mixture into the yolk mixture heated the pudding to about 185 degreesplenty hot to properly thicken it but not so hot that the yolks overcooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMP AND STIR\r\n---\r\n\r\nA New Way to Consistently Perfect Caramel\r\n\r\nThe rich flavor of our butterscotch pudding depends on cooking the caramel mixture to 300 degrees before adding the cream, but its easy to over- or undercook that mixture when its boiled from start to finish (the usual approach). Our more forgiving method: Boil the caramel over medium heat until it reaches 240 degrees, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer it until it reaches 300 degrees. The simmer phase takes about 12 to 16 minutesplenty of time in which to grab a thermometer and the cream.\r\n\r\n', NULL, 'https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/7266-best-butterscotch-pudding?utm_source=Email&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_term=AKOTV&utm_content=AutumnDesserts&utm_campaign=171023&j=30962&sfmc_sub=1262105&l=26_HTML&u=12470556&mid=7211371&jb=473&sk=628FE140599', 3, '2017-10-23 22:00:08', '2017-10-23 22:00:08'),
(86, 'Tuscan-Style Roast Pork with Garlic and Rosemary (Arista)', 'Ingredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 1	lemon\r\n- 1/3	cup extra-virgin olive oil\r\n- 8	garlic cloves, minced\r\n- 1/4	teaspoon red pepper flakes\r\n- 1	tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary\r\n- 2	ounces pancetta, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\r\n- 1	(2 1/2-pound) boneless center-cut pork loin roast, trimmed\r\n- Kosher salt\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\nSERVES 4 TO 6\r\n\r\nWe strongly prefer natural pork in this recipe, but if enhanced pork (injected with a salt solution) is used, reduce the salt to 2 teaspoons (1 teaspoon per side) in step 3. After applying the seasonings, the pork needs to rest, refrigerated, for 1 hour before cooking.\r\n\r\n1. Finely grate 1 teaspoon zest from lemon. Cut lemon in half and reserve. Combine lemon zest, oil, garlic, and pepper flakes in 10-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is sizzling, about 3 minutes. Add rosemary and cook, 30 seconds. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pushing on garlic-rosemary mixture to extract oil. Set oil aside and let garlic-rosemary mixture cool. Using paper towels, wipe out skillet.\r\n2. Process pancetta in food processor until smooth paste forms, 20 to 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add garlic-rosemary mixture and continue to process until mixture is homogeneous, 20 to 30 seconds longer, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.\r\n3. Position roast fat side up. Insert knife one-third of way up from bottom of roast along 1 long side and cut horizontally, stopping 1/2 inch before edge. Open up flap. Keeping knife parallel to cutting board, cut through thicker portion of roast about 1/2 inch from bottom of roast, keeping knife level with first cut and stopping about 1/2 inch before edge. Open up this flap. If uneven, cover with plastic wrap and use meat pounder to even out. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon kosher salt over both sides of roast (1/2 tablespoon per side) and rub into meat to adhere. Spread inside of roast evenly with pancetta-garlic paste, leaving about 1/4-inch border on all sides. Starting from short side, roll roast (keeping fat on outside) and tie with twine at 1-inch intervals. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray. Set roast fat side up on prepared rack and refrigerate for 1 hour.\r\n4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Transfer roast to oven and cook until meat registers 135 degrees, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove roast from oven, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.\r\n5. Heat 1 teaspoon reserved oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add reserved lemon halves, cut side down, and cook until softened and cut surfaces are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer lemon halves to small plate.\r\n6. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons reserved oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until just smoking. Brown roast on fat side and sides (do not brown bottom of roast), 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer roast to carving board and remove twine.\r\n7. Once lemon halves are cool enough to handle, squeeze into fine-mesh strainer set over bowl. Press on solids to extract all pulp; discard solids. Whisk 2 tablespoons strained lemon juice into bowl with remaining reserved oil. Slice roast into 1/4-inch-thick slices and serve, passing vinaigrette separately.\r\n\r\n### For Better Taste, Cook the Paste\r\n\r\nMost recipes call for applying raw garlic and rosemary to the pork before roasting, but this results in harsh flavors. By precooking our paste, we expose the garlic and rosemary to high temperatures and ensure that their flavors are mellowed.\r\n\r\n### Rest, Sear, and Serve\r\n\r\nWhen developing our recipe for Tuscan-Style Roast Pork with Garlic and Rosemary (Arista), we found that most recipes call for letting the roast rest under foil after its been cooked through and browned and then serving it. This allows time for the internal juices to redistribute and for carryover cooking to bring the roast up to the final serving temperature. But covering a well-browned roast with foil will trap steam and cause the crust to soften. By letting it rest after cooking and then searing it and serving it immediately, we guarantee a perfectly crisp crust at the table.\r\n', NULL, 'Cooks Country', 1, '2017-11-16 17:44:44', '2020-11-08 22:57:27'),

So we created our own.\r\n\r\nWhy This Recipe Works\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo replicate the fluffy, souffl-style Sweet Corn Spoonbread from our childhood, we found soaking the cornmeal in milk for a few minutes before simmering eliminated grit. Beating the egg whites with cream of tartar made for a more stable foam and a higher rise. Sauting the kernels in butter helped intensify their flavor, as did adding a little sugar, salt, and cayenne pepper. Steeping the cooked corn in milk before adding it to the cornmeal mixture spread the deep, sweet flavor of sauted corn throughout the spoonbread. To remedy the chewy texture, we pureed the corn and milk in the blender for a silky mixture that resembled (and tasted) like cream of corn soup. Incorporated into the spoonbread, this corn milk\" produced a light, creamy texture and sweet corn taste.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\nServes 6\r\n\r\n- 1	cup cornmeal\r\n- 2 3/4 cups whole milk\r\n- 4	tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n- 2	cups corn kernels (see note)\r\n- 1	teaspoon sugar\r\n- 1	teaspoon salt\r\n- 	teaspoon cayenne pepper\r\n- 3	large eggs, separated\r\n- 	teaspoon cream of tartar\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou will need 3 or 4 ears of corn to yield 2 cups of kernels.

(90, 'Classic Pot Roast with Root Vegetables', 'Published November 2010\r\n\r\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe started our pot roast recipe by choosing well-marbled chuck-eye roast, which is full of collagen and well suited for braising. Opening the pot roast and trimming away the excess interior fat got rid of the pesky globs that refused to render as the pot roast cooked. Leaving the meat in two smaller roasts also shaved cooking time from our pot roast recipe and allowed the salt we used to season the lobes to penetrate even further. And finally, roasted vegetables thickened the pot roasts gravy and glutamate-rich ingredients beefed up its rich flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n---\r\n\r\n1	(3 1/2- to 4-pound) boneless beef chuck-eye roast, pulled into two pieces at natural seam and trimmed of large knobs of fat\r\nKosher salt\r\n2	tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n2	medium onions, halved and sliced thin (about 2 cups)\r\n1	large carrot, chopped medium (about 1 cup)\r\n1	celery rib, chopped medium (about 3/4 cup)\r\n2	medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\r\n1	cup beef broth, plus 1 to 2 cups for sauce (see note)\r\n	cup dry red wine, plus 1/4 cup for sauce\r\n1	tablespoon tomato paste\r\n1	bay leaf\r\n1	sprig plus 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves\r\nGround black pepper\r\n1	tablespoon balsamic vinegar\r\n1	pound carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces\r\n1	pound parsnips, peeled and cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces\r\n1 	pounds russet potatoes, peeled and halved lengthwise, each half quartered\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n---\r\n\r\nSERVES 6 TO 8\r\n\r\nOur recommended beef broth is Rachael Ray Stock-in-a-Box Beef Flavored Stock. Chilling the whole cooked pot roast overnight improves its flavor and makes it moister and easier to slice; for instructions, see Make-Ahead Pot Roast.\r\n\r\n1. Sprinkle pieces of meat with 1 tablespoon salt (1 teaspoons if using table salt), place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.\r\n2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Heat butter in heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add carrot and celery; continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes longer. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup broth,  cup wine, tomato paste, bay leaf, and thyme sprig; bring to simmer.\r\n3. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season generously with pepper. Using 3 pieces of kitchen twine, tie each piece of meat into loaf shape for even cooking.\r\n4. Nestle meat on top of vegetables. Cover pot tightly with large piece of foil and cover with lid; transfer pot to oven. Cook beef for three hours flipping halfway through cooking, and add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes. Continue cooking until beef is fully tender and sharp knife easily slips in and out of meat, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Once pot roast and vegetables are fully cooked, transfer large pieces of carrot, parsnip, and potato to serving platter using slotted spoon, cover tightly with foil, and proceed with recipe as directed.\r\n5. Transfer roasts to cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Strain liquid through mesh strainer into 4-cup liquid measuring cup. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprig. Transfer vegetables to blender jar. Allow liquid to settle 5 minutes, then skim any fat off surface. Add beef broth as necessary to bring liquid amount to 3 cups. Place liquid in blender with vegetables and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer sauce to medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat.\r\n6. While sauce heats, remove twine from roast and slice against grain into -inch-thick slices. Transfer meat to large serving platter. Stir chopped thyme, remaining  cup wine, and vinegar into sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon half of sauce over meat; pass remaining sauce separately.\r\n\r\nSTEP-BY-STEP\r\n\r\nKeys to a Flavorful Pot Roast\r\n\r\n1. SALT ROASTSprinkling the roast halves with salt and resting them for 1 hour improves meaty flavor.\r\n2. ADD (A LITTLE) LIQUIDAdding just 1 1/2 cups of liquid to the pot leads to a more intensely flavored gravy.\r\n3. SEAL POTSealing the pot with foil before covering locks in valuable juices and ensures that the roast has enough liquid for braising.\r\n4. BULK UP GRAVYPureeing the onions, carrots, and celery cooked with the roast and combining them with the gravy adds body and flavor.\r\n\r\nRECIPE TESTING\r\n\r\nLow-Temperature Browning\r\nWhen meat is seared at very high temperatures, the Maillard reaction rapidly kicks in, rendering the exterior deeply browned and flavorful. But can browning take place at lower temperatures in the moist, closed environment of a braise, where the temperature can never rise above the boiling point of water, 212 degrees?\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nWe cooked two pot roasts: one that we seared before adding liquid to the pot, and the other we placed directly in the pot without searing.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe dry part of the two roasts that sat above the liquid had a similar level of browning, and the unseared roast tasted nearly as good as the seared one.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nIn the searing heat of a 500-degree pan, the Maillard reaction quickly produces countless new flavor compounds that improve taste. But given enough time, browning can also occur at temperatures as low as 160 degrees. Our pot roast cooks for a good 3 hours, ample time for lots of new flavor compounds to be created on the dry top part of the meat. Though these compounds wont be as plentiful or richly flavorful as when browning occurs at higher temperatures, we felt that we could skip the sear.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6225-classic-pot-roast-with-root-vegetables?sqn=vUb1lqcg7%2BXiJ2sai2RTqg%3D%3D%0A&sk=628FE140599D35BFC5B0A8ADC23C00CF&extcode=EZ17K4QCA&sourcekey=CZ17104CA&cds_response_key=&cds_tracking_code=&tag=crmengage-20&atc=crmE&Survey_id=&mi_ecmp=\r\n\r\n\r\n', NULL, '', 1, '2017-11-21 21:08:22', '2017-11-21 21:08:22'),

If only it actually worked.\r\n\r\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\r\n\r\nThese individual chocolate cakes are cooked in coffee mugs in the microwave for a nearly instant dessert. To keep our cakes from overflowing, we had to supplement bittersweet chocolate with cocoa powder; cocoa powder has less fat, which produces less steam, thus less chance of an overflow. Microwaving the cakes on 50 percent power was the key to cooking them gently, helping create a light, tender crumb, and stirring the batter halfway through ensured even cooking. Finally, a few chunks of bittersweet chocolate added to each cake created a gooey, molten center.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 4	tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n- 1	ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped, plus 1 ounce broken into 4 equal pieces\r\n- 	cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar\r\n- 2	large eggs\r\n- 2	tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\r\n- 1	teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n- 	teaspoon salt\r\n- 	cup (1 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour\r\n- 	teaspoon baking powder\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe developed this recipe in a full-size, 1200-watt microwave.

(97, 'The Ultimate Crispy Fried Chicken', 'Why This Recipe Works\r\n---\r\n\r\nOur best fried chicken recipe would be worth the splatter and mess, producing seasoned meat coated with a crisp mahogany crust. We found that cutting up a whole chicken and brining it in a mixture of buttermilk, salt, and spices was the way to begin. Air-drying the brined chicken gave us an extra-crisp skin. To finish our fried chicken recipe, we coated the chicken with a mixture of flour, baking powder, and baking soda for a light, shatteringly crisp crust and pan-fried it in peanut oil for clean flavor.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 1  cups kosher salt or 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons table salt\r\n-  cup granulated sugar\r\n- 2 tablespoons paprika\r\n- 3 medium heads garlic, cloves separated\r\n- 3 bay leaves, crumbled\r\n- 2 quarts buttermilk (low fat)\r\n- 1 whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds), giblets discarded, cut into 12 pieces (see illustrations below)\r\n- 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour\r\n- 1 large egg\r\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\r\n-  teaspoon baking soda\r\n- 34 cups refined peanut oil or vegetable shortening\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n---\r\n\r\nServes 4 to 6\r\n\r\nMaintaining an even oil temperature is key to the success of this recipe. An instant-read thermometer with a high upper range is perfect for checking the temperature; a clip-on candy/deep-fry thermometer is fine, though it can be clipped to the pot only for the uncovered portion of frying.\r\n\r\n1. In large zipper-lock plastic bag, combine salt, sugar, paprika, garlic cloves, and bay leaves. With rubber mallet or flat meat pounder, smash garlic into salt and spice mixture thoroughly. Pour mixture into large plastic container or nonreactive stockpot. Add 7 cups buttermilk and stir until salt is completely dissolved. Immerse chicken and refrigerate until fully seasoned, 2 to 3 hours. Remove chicken from buttermilk brine and shake off excess; place in single layer on large wire rack set over rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered for 2 hours. (After 2 hours, chicken can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 6 hours longer.)\r\n\r\n2. Measure flour into large shallow dish. Beat egg, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl; stir in remaining 1 cup buttermilk (mixture will bubble and foam). Working in batches of 3, drop chicken pieces in flour and shake pan to coat. Shake excess flour from each piece, then, using tongs, dip chicken pieces into egg mixture, turning to coat well and allowing excess to drip off. Coat chicken pieces with flour again, shake off excess, and return to wire rack.\r\n\r\n3. Adjust oven rack to middle position, set second wire rack over second rimmed baking sheet, and place on oven rack; heat oven to 200 degrees. Line large plate with double layer paper towels. Meanwhile, heat oil (oil should have 2 1/2-inch depth in pan) to 375 degrees over medium-high heat in large 8-quart cast-iron Dutch oven with a diameter of about 12 inches. Place half of chicken pieces skin-side down in oil, cover, reduce heat to medium, and fry until deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes; after about 3 minutes, lift chicken pieces with tongs to check for even browning; rearrange if some pieces are browning faster than others. (Spot-check oil temperature; after first 6 minutes of frying, oil should be about 325 degrees. Adjust burner if necessary.) Turn chicken pieces over and continue to fry, uncovered, until chicken pieces are deep golden brown on second side, 6 to 8 minutes longer. Using tongs, transfer chicken to paper towellined plate; let stand 2 minutes to drain, then transfer to rack in warm oven. Replace paper towellining on plate. Return oil to 375 degrees and fry remaining pieces, transferring pieces to paper towellined plate to drain, then transferring to wire rack with other chicken pieces. Cool chicken pieces on wire rack about 5 minutes and serve.\r\n', NULL, 'Test Kitchen', 1, '2018-05-09 00:03:01', '2018-05-09 00:03:01'),

While we wanted juiciness from the berries in our shortcakes recipe, we didn\'t want juice onlythat is, entirely crushed berries. But neither did we want dry chunks of fruit falling off the biscuit and onto the plate. Our solution was a compromise: Preserve the shape of some berries by quartering them and release the juice of the others by mashing them.', NULL, 'https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/1239-rich-and-tender-shortcakes-with-strawberries-and-whipped-cream', 3, '2018-05-14 21:38:25', '2018-05-14 21:39:11'),

Process ancho pieces in blender until finely chopped, about 20 seconds. Add one-quarter of tomatoes and 1 teaspoon chipotle. Process on low speed, scraping down sides of blender jar if necessary, until tomatoes are finely chopped and ancho pieces are moistened, about 45 seconds. Let mixture sit for 15 minutes.\r\n2. Meanwhile, line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Adjust oven rack 4 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Place remaining tomatoes skin side down on prepared sheet. Add onion and jalapeo and broil until onion and jalapeo are blackened and tomatoes are beginning to turn spotty brown, 4 to 6 minutes.

We added a layer of char flavor by quickly broiling the jalapeo, garlic, onion, and halved tomatoes. A dried ancho chile added a welcome fruitiness. Instead of hydrating the ancho in water and then draining it, we processed it in the blender and then combined it with a fresh tomato. Minced canned chipotle chile contributed a hint of smoke, and by withholding most of the chipotle until the end, we were able to customize the heat level.\r\n\r\nChiles vary in heat level, so adjust the amount of chipotle to your taste.

(112, 'Misc NY Times', 'Pork Chops in Lemon-Caper Sauce\r\n===\r\n\r\n- YIELD 4 servings\r\n- TIME 35 minutes\r\n\r\nSarah Anne Ward for The New York Times. Food stylist: Maggie Ruggiero. Prop stylist: Paola Andrea.\r\nHeres my favorite recipe in Toni Tipton-Martins excellent and invaluable Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African-American Cooking (2019). Its a remix of one that the chef Nathaniel Burton collected into his 1978 opus, Creole Feast: Fifteen Master Chefs of New Orleans Reveal Their Secrets, and one that Tipton-Martin glossed-up with lemon zest, juice and extra butter, a technique she learned from the restaurateur B. Smiths 2009 collection of recipes, B. Smith Cooks Southern-Style. Its a dish of smothered pork chops, essentially, made into something glorious and elegant. The food history of blacks in America has been a story of the food of survival, she told me in an interview. We need to start celebrating the food they made at work.\"\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 4  bone-in pork chops (about 8 ounces each)\r\n- Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste\r\n-   teaspoon dried thyme leaves\r\n- 2  tablespoons olive oil\r\n- 4  tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n- 1  very small shallot, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\r\n- 2  garlic cloves, minced (about 1 teaspoon)\r\n- 2  teaspoons all-purpose flour\r\n- 1  cup dry white wine\r\n- 1   cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium, if store-bought\r\n- 2  tablespoons drained capers\r\n- 2  tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish\r\n- 1  teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons juice\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Dry the chops with paper towels, and season aggressively with salt, pepper and the thyme. Swirl the olive oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium until the oil begins to shimmer. Add chops, and cook until well browned on each side and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, and cover to keep warm.\r\n\r\n2. Drain the fat from the skillet, then melt 2 tablespoons of butter in it over medium heat until sizzling. Add the shallot and garlic, and saut until the aromatics soften, reducing the heat if necessary, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the wine and chicken stock, raise heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Stir in the capers, parsley, lemon zest and juice and hot sauce to taste (if youre using it), and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until its melted and the sauce looks smooth. Nestle the pork chops into the sauce, and allow them to warm up for a couple of minutes, then serve, pouring sauce over each pork chop to taste. Garnish with more fresh parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuli Huli Chicken\r\n=================\r\n\r\n- YIELD: 4 to 6 servings\r\n- TIME: 45 minutes, plus 8 hours marinating\r\n\r\nIn 1955, Ernest Morgado, a Honolulu businessman, served a group of farmers grilled chicken that had been marinated in his mothers teriyaki-style sauce. It was such a hit that he decided to market it with the name huli huli. Huli means turn in Hawaiian and refers to how its prepared: grilled between two racks and turned halfway through cooking. This simplified version calls for chicken pieces and a standard grill. The original recipe is a trade secret, but you can find many slightly different variations on the internet, typically including ginger, garlic, soy sauce, something sweet (honey, brown sugar or maple syrup) and something acidic (vinegar, white wine, lime juice or pineapple juice). This recipe is adapted from Aloha Kitchen: Recipes from Hawaii by Alana Kysar (Ten Speed, March 2019). It also works beautifully with boneless chicken thighs, but adjust your cooking time accordingly.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   cup ketchup\r\n-   cup soy sauce\r\n-   cup packed light or dark brown sugar\r\n-   cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar\r\n- 1  (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated\r\n- 2 to 3  garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated\r\n- 3  to 4  pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces\r\n- Grapeseed or canola oil, for brushing the grill grate\r\n \r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. In a large bowl or a gallon-size resealable plastic bag, combine the ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger and garlic, and stir or shake until combined. \r\n2. Reserve and refrigerate 1/2 cup of the mixture for basting the chicken later. \r\n3. Add the chicken to the remaining mixture, and stir or shake until evenly coated. If using a bowl, cover with plastic wrap. \r\n4. Refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours, turning the chicken at least once.\r\n5. When youre ready to cook, oil your grill grates well. Heat the grill to medium (for charcoal, the grill is ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 5 to 7 seconds). \r\n6. Add the chicken to the grill, cover, and cook 25 to 35 minutes, turning every 5 minutes to keep the chicken from burning, and basting it with the reserved marinade after you turn it, until cooked through. (Cook times will vary depending on sizes and cuts of chicken pieces, so be sure to check for doneness: Meat should not be pink and the juices should run clear.) \r\n7. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\nSouthern Macaroni and Cheese\r\n============================\r\n\r\n- YIELD 8 to 10 servings\r\n- TIME 35 minutes, plus cooling\r\n\r\nThere is macaroni and cheese, and then there is special occasion macaroni and cheese like this one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. Its adapted from Millie Peartree, the owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl growing up in Georgia. The recipe was passed down in her family for generations, but because of the generous amount of cheese used, the dish was only made for events like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a gooey, molten center. If you cant find a Colby Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a Mexican-style blend will work in its place.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Kosher salt and black pepper\r\n- 1  pound elbow macaroni\r\n- 2  cups whole milk\r\n- 2  large eggs\r\n- 4  cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar (about 16 ounces)\r\n-   cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted\r\n- 2  cups shredded Colby Jack (about 8 ounces)\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions until a little under al dente, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.\r\n2. In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp Cheddar, melted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir until well combined.\r\n3. Add half the macaroni mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups Colby Jack evenly on top. Spread the remaining macaroni mixture on top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum foil, transfer to the middle rack of the oven and bake for 20 minutes.\r\n4. Remove from oven. Carefully remove and discard the aluminum foil. Top the macaroni mixture with the remaining 2 cups Cheddar and 1/2 cup Colby Jack. Broil on top rack until cheese is browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled cheese can go from golden to burnt fairly quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)\r\n5. Remove from oven and let cool until the macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to 15 minutes. (The mixture may first appear jiggly, but it will firm up as it cools.) Serve warm.\r\n\r\nOne-Pot Pasta With Ricotta and Lemon\r\n====================================\r\n\r\n- YIELD 4 servings\r\n- TIME 15 minutes\r\n\r\nThis elegant, bright pasta dish comes together in about the same amount of time it takes to boil noodles and heat up a jar of store-bought marinara. The no-cook sauce is a 50-50 mix of ricotta and Parmesan, with the zest and juice of one lemon thrown in. Thats it. To make it more filling, add peas, asparagus or spinach in the last few minutes of the pasta boiling, or stir in fresh arugula or watercress with the sauce in Step 3. Its a weeknight and for-company keeper any way you stir it.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Kosher salt\r\n- 1  pound short, ribbed pasta, like gemelli or penne\r\n- 1  cup whole-milk ricotta (8 ounces)\r\n- 1  cup freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino (2 ounces), plus more for serving\r\n- 1  tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest plus 1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)\r\n- Black pepper\r\n- Red-pepper flakes, for serving\r\n-   cup thinly sliced or torn basil leaves, for serving (optional)\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.\r\n2. In the same pot, make the sauce: Add the ricotta, Parmesan, lemon zest and juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir until well combined.\r\n3. Add 1/2 cup pasta water to the sauce and stir until smooth. Add the pasta and continue to stir vigorously until the noodles are well coated. Add more pasta water as needed for a smooth sauce.\r\n4. Divide the pasta among bowls and top with some of the sauce thats pooled at the bottom of the pot. Garnish with grated Parmesan, black pepper, red-pepper flakes and basil, if using.\r\n\r\nCrisp Gnocchi With Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n- YIELD 4 servings\r\n- TIME 20 minutes\r\n\r\nFor a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sauted brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 1  pound brussels sprouts\r\n- 1  lemon\r\n-   cup extra-virgin olive oil\r\n- Kosher salt and black pepper\r\n-   teaspoon red-pepper flakes\r\n- 1  (18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\r\n- 6  tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\r\n-   teaspoon honey\r\n- Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\r\n \r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\r\n2. In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut-side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\r\n3. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.', NULL, 'NY Times', 1, '2019-12-11 00:32:53', '2019-12-11 16:14:31'),

(114, 'Shrimp Scampi', '\r\n    \r\nSERVES 4\r\n\r\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\r\nOur shrimp scampi recipe uses a few test kitchen tricks to ensure flavorful and well-cooked shrimp along with a cohesive, garlicky wine-and-butter sauce. First, we brine the shrimp in salt and sugar to season them throughout and keep them moist and juicy. Then we poach them in wine rather than saut them, so they cook evenly and gently. To get good seafood flavor into the sauce, we make a stock from the shrimp shells. And for potent garlic flavor, we use a generous amount of sliced garlictoo much minced garlic made the sauce grainy. Finally, to keep the sauce silky and emulsified, we added a teaspoon of cornstarch. Emulsifying with cornstarch means that we can use a little less butter, so the sauce isnt overly rich. Read Less\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n3 tablespoons salt\r\n2 tablespoons sugar\r\n1  pounds shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved\r\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\r\n1 cup dry white wine\r\n4 sprigs fresh thyme\r\n3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving\r\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\r\n8 garlic cloves, sliced thin\r\n teaspoon red pepper flakes\r\n teaspoon pepper\r\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\r\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\r\nExtra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound) can be substituted for jumbo shrimp. If you use them, reduce the cooking time in step 3 by 1 to 2 minutes. We prefer untreated shrimp, but if your shrimp are treated with sodium or preservatives like sodium tripolyphosphate, skip the brining in step 1 and add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the sauce in step 4. Serve with crusty bread.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\nDissolve salt and sugar in 1 quart cold water in large container. Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.\r\n\r\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Strain mixture through colander set over large bowl. Discard shells and reserve liquid (you should have about 2/3 cup). Wipe out skillet with paper towels.\r\n\r\nCombine lemon juice and cornstarch in small bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and pepper in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown at edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes.

(115, 'Vanilla Marshmallows', 'YIELD: 48 marshmallows\r\nTIME: 30 minutes, plus at least 4 hours resting\r\n\r\nHomemade marshmallows should have their own dreamy name, something that makes it clear that theyre different from the supermarket stuff. When you make this recipe by Christine Moore of Little Flower Candy Co., you get puffs that are soft, tender, languidly stretchy and delicately sweet, and a lesson in the transformative power of heat and air. To make these, you beat together roiling-hot sugar syrup and gelatin, and watch as the mixture goes from murky to opaque, from beige to white, from thin to billowing. For this magic to happen, it takes almost 15 minutes, plus a very large bowl and a sturdy mixer. (I use a 5-quart stand mixer.) You need no special skills, just patience  you have to wait a few hours for the whipped mixture to dry  but youll be rewarded with singular sweets good for toasting, smores, snacking and wrapping up as gifts.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n- 1   cups/360 milliliters cold water\r\n- 6  (1/4-ounce) packets unflavored powdered gelatin (about 1/4 cup/40 grams total)\r\n- 2   cups/500 grams granulated sugar\r\n- 1  cup/240 milliliters light corn syrup\r\n- 2  teaspoons pure vanilla extract\r\n-   vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped (or 1 more teaspoon vanilla extract)\r\n-  Nonstick cooking spray\r\n-   cup/65 grams cornstarch\r\n-   cup/60 grams confectioners sugar\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Pour 3/4 cup/180 milliliters cold water into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the gelatin on top, and set aside until the gelatin has absorbed the liquid and expanded, 5 to 8 minutes, stirring after 3 minutes.\r\n2. Meanwhile, add the granulated sugar, corn syrup and the remaining 3/4 cup/180 milliliters water to a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Clip a candy thermometer to the pan or have an instant-read thermometer at hand. Boil until the syrup reaches 240 degrees, 5 to 6 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat.\r\n3. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment, turn to low and slowly add the syrup, pouring it down the sides of the bowl. Add the extract and the vanilla-bean seeds (or extra extract). When the syrup is fully incorporated, gradually increase the mixer speed to high, and whip until the mixture is thick and cooled to room temperature, about 12 minutes.\r\n4. While the marshmallow mixture is whipping, coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Combine the cornstarch and confectioners sugar in a medium bowl, then generously dust the inside of the pan with some of the cornstarch mixture. (Its important that the bottom of the pan be very well covered.)\r\n5. Coat a plastic bowl scraper and your hand with nonstick spray. Scrape the marshmallow mixture into the pan. Use the flat side of the scraper to get the mixture into the corners of the pan and to even out the surface. Sift some of the cornstarch mixture over the top. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and let rest for at least 4 hours before cutting.\r\n6. Cut the marshmallows: Dust a chefs knife with some of the cornstarch mixture; dust a piece of parchment paper, too.

Next we toasted crushed Sichuan peppercorns and arbol chiles that we\'d halved lengthwise to release their heat. We stirred in plenty of garlic and ginger and then added marinated diced chicken thighs. We covered the skillet to facilitate quick and even cooking of the chicken. When it was almost cooked through, we added some celery for crisp freshness and then a quick and concentrated sauce mixture that cooked down to a glaze. Stirring in the scallions and toasted peanuts last ensured that they retained their all-important crunch\r\n\r\nChicken and Sauce\r\n\r\n1  pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into -inch cubes\r\n cup soy sauce, divided\r\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\r\n1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry\r\n teaspoon white pepper\r\n1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar\r\n1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar\r\n2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil\r\nStir-Fry\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\r\n2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger\r\n2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided\r\n cup dry-roasted peanuts\r\n10 - 15 dried arbol chiles, halved lengthwise and seeded\r\n1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, ground coarse\r\n2 celery ribs, cut into -inch pieces\r\n5 scallions, white and light green parts only, cut into -inch pieces\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\r\nKung pao chicken should be quite spicy. To adjust the heat level, use more or fewer chiles, depending on the size (we used 2-inch-long chiles) and your taste.

(120, 'Schnitzel', 'YIELD: 4 servings  \r\nTIME: 30 minutes, plus overnight drying\r\n\r\nDavid Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated schnitzels in Vienna feature a crisp golden crust that puffs dramatically around a thinly pounded veal cutlet (pork loin cutlets are an easy, inexpensive alternative to veal), allowing the meat to cook gently within. Head over to Germany and you are more likely to find schnitzel with a crust that adheres to the meat. Both versions can be fantastic. For an extra-puffy crust, brush the cutlets with vodka before breading them. The volatility of the alcohol produces steam that inflates the schnitzel as it fries. (Water or white vinegar will also work if you want to avoid using alcohol.) If you prefer a crust that adheres more closely to the meat, whack the cutlets with the back of a knife a few times after pounding them in Step 3 to create an uneven surface texture; dry the meat well on paper towels, and skip the vodka coating in Step 5.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- 4  kaiser rolls, 12 slices hearty sandwich bread or 12 ounces store-bought plain bread crumbs (about 3 cups/340 grams); see Note\r\n- 4  boneless, center-cut pork loin chops, about 1/2-inch thick (4 to 5 ounces each), fat mostly trimmed (see Note)\r\n- Kosher salt and black pepper\r\n- 2  cups/about 280 grams all-purpose flour\r\n- 4 to 5  large eggs, beaten with a fork just until roughly homogenous\r\n-   cup/60 milliliters 80-proof vodka\r\n- 2  pounds lard or clarified butter, or 1 quart oil (see Note)\r\n- Lemon wedges, lingonberry jam or cranberry sauce, for serving\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1. With a chefs knife, cut the bread (including the crusts) into 1/2- to 1-inch cubes and spread on a baking sheet in a single layer. Set them out overnight until completely dry. Alternatively, place the baking sheet in a 200-degree oven until the bread is completely dry but not browned at all, turning and stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Transfer dried bread to a mini chopper or food processor, and process until as fine as possible, about 1 minute.\r\n2. Transfer bread crumbs to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl. Sift the fine crumbs into the bowl, leaving behind coarser crumbs. Discard the coarse crumbs, or process and sift again. (You can repeat this several times, but there are diminishing returns.)\r\nWorking one at a time, place a cutlet between two sheets of parchment paper or in a heavy-duty zip-top bag. Pound with a flat mallet or the bottom of a skillet or saucepan, aiming at the thickest parts with the heel of the pan. The goal is to stretch the pork cutlets to about four times their original surface area (twice as wide, twice as long) with about 1/8-inch thickness. Do not pound so aggressively that the meat tears or frays. Transfer to a large plate or tray, season lightly with salt and pepper, and repeat with remaining cutlets.\r\n3. When ready to cook, heat oven to 225 degrees. Set up a breading station next to the stove with four rimmed baking sheets or dishes large enough to fit one cutlet with plenty of space around it. Leave the one farthest from the stove empty, add flour to the second, beaten eggs to the third, and the bread crumbs to the one closest to the stove. (It will seem like too many bread crumbs, and that is OK.)\r\n4. Add the vodka to a small bowl. Nearby, have a pastry brush, a clean kitchen towel, a timer, a large fork or thin slotted spatula, a large plate lined with paper towels, extra paper towels, a cooling rack set in a rimmed sheet pan, a fine-mesh fat skimmer in a small saucepan or heatproof bowl, and an instant-read thermometer.\r\n5. When ready to cook, heat the lard in a large wok, Dutch oven or deep, steep-walled saut pan over medium-high until it registers 375 to 400 degrees on the instant-read thermometer. Adjust flame to maintain that temperature throughout the cooking process.\r\nWorking one at a time, place a cutlet in the empty rimmed baking sheet. Brush the meat with vodka, completely covering both sides with a thin layer. Immediately transfer the cutlet to the flour. Gently shake the baking sheet. Then, using your fingertips, pick up the cutlet from one edge and flip it over. Shake the baking sheet again to coat the second side with flour. Pick up the cutlet with your fingertips, shake gently to knock off excess flour, then inspect to ensure that there is a thin, even layer of flour across the whole cutlet. If necessary, re-dredge it to cover up any un-floured spots, but be careful not to fold the cutlet, which can cause the flour to bunch.\r\n6. Lay the cutlet onto the eggs. Shake the baking sheet gently. Using your fingertips, pick up the cutlet from one edge and flip it over. Pick up the cutlet with your fingertips, allowing excess egg to drain for a few seconds, then inspect to ensure that the cutlet is thoroughly coated. If necessary, dip the cutlet back into the egg to cover any dry spots.\r\n7. Transfer the cutlet to the bread crumbs. Using your fingers, scoop crumbs from around the cutlet and pile them on top, completely covering the cutlet. Do not press on the crumbs or cutlet at any point. Shake the baking sheet for a few seconds. Then, using your fingertips, pick up the cutlet from one edge, flip it, and return it to the bread crumbs. Shake the baking sheet, then pick up the cutlet with your fingertips and gently shake off excess crumbs, being careful not to fold or crease the cutlet.\r\n8. Carefully lay the cutlet onto the hot fat, starting near you and draping it away from you to avoid accidentally splashing yourself with hot oil. As fast as you can, wipe your fingers clean on the kitchen towel. Then, start swirling the pan, allowing the fat to splash over and around the cutlet for exactly 30 seconds. Using the fork or a thin, slotted spatula, pick up the cutlet from one edge and carefully flip it, being careful not to splash hot fat. Continue to cook, swirling. The cutlet should start to puff and inflate. Keep cooking while swirling until the cutlet is golden brown and crisp, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.\r\n9. Using the fork or slotted spatula, pick up the cutlet from one edge and transfer to the paper towel-lined plate. Blot the top very gently with an extra paper towel, then transfer to the rack on the rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven to keep warm. Use the fine-mesh strainer to skim off the foam and remove as many stray bread crumbs from the fat as possible.\r\n10. Reheat the fat to 375 to 400 degrees and repeat Steps 7 to 11 for the remaining cutlets.\r\n11. Serve cutlets immediately with lemon wedges, lingonberry jam or cranberry sauce.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\nStore-bought canned plain bread crumbs work well here and eliminate the time it takes for the bread to dry. (If using them, skip Step 1.) For homemade crumbs, kaiser rolls are the traditional choice, and if you have a local bakery or supermarket that bakes them fresh, use them. Dont use shelf-stable bagged kaiser rolls; theyll be too soft. Any hearty white sandwich bread with a fine hole structure will also work. (But dont use sourdough, baguettes, any other rustic, crusty breads, or brioche.)\r\n\r\nThe more uniform the pork loin chops, the better the coating will puff. This recipe will also work with veal, chicken breast, turkey breast, or pork sirloin cutlets. If using chicken or turkey, take time to gently pound them out to avoid tearing the more delicate meat.\r\n\r\nLard or clarified butter will give the pork better flavor, but oil will also work fine. After frying, allow the fat to sit until cool enough to handle, then pour it through a fine-mesh strainer lined with paper towels or a coffee filter into a bowl. Transfer to a container to store for future use. The same fat can be used for several dozen fries until it becomes too dark and starts to develop a fishy aroma.', NULL, 'https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021973-schnitzel', 1, '2021-03-19 18:55:56', '2021-03-19 18:55:56'),

It is not quite the same.\r\nMany farmers markets now have holy basil.\r\nHoly basil doesnt stay fresh (or green) long in the refrigerator. So use the basil as soon as you can.

(134, 'Pad Krapow Gai (Thai Basil Chicken)', 'As dynamic as it is speedy, this ground chicken and green bean recipe from Night + Market (Clarkson Potter, 2017) by Kris Yenbamroong and Garrett Snyder, delivers a wallop of flavor with punchy ingredients that stir-fry in just 15 minutes. While this popular Thai street food can be whipped up using a range of proteins, Mr. Yenbamroong refers to his riff as low-rent because its prepared with ground chicken rather than pricier slices of meat. Its piled with basil; Thai basil or holy basil provide more assertive licorice notes, but sweet basil adds herbal bursts of brightness. Spiked with Thai seasoning (see Tip), the chicken mixture is salty on its own, but its inextricably linked with rice, and imparts the right amount of salinity when dispersed.  Alexa Weibel\r\n\r\nYield: 2 to 4 servings\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n---\r\n\r\n-  cup vegetable oil\r\n- 1 pound ground chicken (preferably dark meat)\r\n- 2 teaspoons minced garlic (from 2 cloves)\r\n- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar\r\n- 1 teaspoon minced fresh birds-eye chile or other fresh chile (from 1 chile)\r\n- 8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into -inch pieces (about 1 cups)\r\n- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce\r\n- 2 tablespoons fish sauce\r\n- 1 tablespoon Thai seasoning sauce (such as Golden Mountain; see Tip)\r\n- 1 cup loosely packed basil leaves (preferably Thai basil or holy basil)\r\n- Ground white pepper, to taste\r\n- Steamed jasmine rice, for serving\r\n- 4 crispy fried eggs (optional)\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high, then swirl in the oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the ground chicken and cook, actively breaking the chicken up into small pieces, until it is mostly cooked, about 6 minutes.\r\n2. Stir in the garlic, sugar and chile until evenly distributed and fragrant, about 2 minutes, then add the green beans, oyster sauce, fish sauce and Thai seasoning, and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is fully cooked, the green beans are crisp-tender and the krapow is glossy, about 2 minutes.\r\n3. Remove from heat, add the basil and a dash of white pepper and toss to combine. If the sauce seems to cling too tightly to the mixture, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to make it loose and glossy.\r\n4. Serve over rice, and top with a crispy fried egg, if desired. Serve with additional Thai seasoning to sprinkle on top, according to taste.\r\n\r\nTip\r\n---\r\n\r\nGolden Mountain is made with fermented soybeans, like soy sauce, and imparts sweetness along with its jolt of salinity. It can be purchased in Asian supermarkets or online and lasts indefinitely.

Preheat oven to 400F (204C) with the convection fan turned off and oven rack in center position. Liberally butter the interiors of eight 4-ounce ramekins, making sure to butter right up to the upper edge of the rim of each ramekin. Sugar the buttered insides evenly, tapping out excess, and set ramekins aside.\r\n\r\n2. Place 2 1/2 cups water in a 3-quart sauce pan on the stove over medium heat. In a large, heat-proof bowl that will sit comfortably on the pot without toppling over or touching the water below, combine cream and/or milk, dark chocolate, and unsweetened chocolate. Whisk gently until chocolate is melted, cream and/or milk are fully incorporated, and a smooth ganache has formed.\r\n\r\n3. Turn off heat, then carefully whisk in cocoa powder, water, and vanilla extract until smooth. Leave bowl atop pot of hot water, off the heat, to keep the ganache warm.\r\n\r\n4.
